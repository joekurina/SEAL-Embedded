Loads (one component of) the public key from storage.

A full public key consists of two components per modulus prime in the modulus switching chain. For
example, if there are 3 primes in the modulus switching chain, the public key would consists of 3
per-prime public keys PK0, PK1, PK2, where each PKi conists of two polynomials {pk0, pk1}, for a
total of 6 polynomials, and therefore 6 components.

particular public key component, if the public key is in non-ntt form. If the public key is in NTT
